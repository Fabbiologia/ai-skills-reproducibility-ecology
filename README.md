# Do AI skills improve the output reproducibility of ecological analyses?

Reproducibility repository for the manuscript **"Do AI skills improve the output
reproducibility of ecological analyses? Controlled experiments"** (target journal:
*Methods in Ecology and Evolution*).

This repository contains everything needed to reproduce the experiment, its figures
and statistics, and to rebuild the manuscript and Supporting Information documents
from source.

## What the study does

AI *skills* are reusable, structured instructions for LLM and agent tools. No earlier
study had directly tested whether they improve the **output reproducibility** of
ecological analyses. This repository holds a controlled experiment that tests it: a
fully crossed **4 (task) by 5 (skill level) by 2 (language: Python and R) by 10
(replicate) = 400-run** design in which independent LLM agents each run an analysis
and return a structured result. The five skill levels add one kind of instruction at
a time (none, basic, contract, controls, full), so the experiment shows which part of
a skill does the work, and the two languages test whether different code reaches the
same answer. A short literature review sets the context and is not a formal
systematic review.

**Headline result:** skills improve output reproducibility through *constraint*, not
verbosity, and the decisive feature is task-dependent. Fix the stochastic controls
(seed/split/scaling) where randomness exists, and fix the input/method contract where
a domain convention is ambiguous. Reproducibility and validity are separable: an
analysis can be perfectly consistent yet consistently wrong. Python and R give the
same answer for the deterministic tasks, but not for the classifier, where the two
languages use different random number generators.

## Two reproducibility layers

**1. Deterministic (fully reproducible here).** Everything downstream of the raw run
data — all tables, statistics, figures, and the Word documents — regenerates exactly
from `results_v2.json` with `analyze_v2.py` and the manuscript build scripts. This is
what the `Makefile` / `Dockerfile` reproduce.

**2. The agent runs (require an LLM-agent harness).** `results_v2.json` was produced by
`run_experiment.workflow.js` orchestrating 200 independent LLM coding agents (built on
a single underlying model) via the Claude Code agent/workflow harness. The prompts
(`generate_prompts.py`, `prompts/`) and orchestration are provided in full for
transparency, but **re-running the agents requires that harness and will not
bit-reproduce**, because the agents are stochastic — which is precisely the
phenomenon the experiment measures. The provided `results_v2.json` is the archival
run set for the paper.

---

## Quickstart — reproduce the analysis and documents

Requires Python 3.11+ and Node.js 18+.

```bash
# 1. install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd manuscript && npm install && cd ..

# 2. regenerate all tables, statistics and figures from the raw run data
python analyze_v2.py

# 3. rebuild the manuscript and Supporting Information .docx
cd manuscript && node build_manuscript.js && node build_si.js && cd ..
```

Or use the Makefile:

```bash
make setup       # pip install + npm install
make reproduce   # analyze_v2.py + rebuild both .docx (deterministic)
make all         # also regenerate the prompt files
```

### Containerised (Docker)

```bash
docker build -t mee-repro .
docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/work" mee-repro   # runs `make reproduce`
```

The container reproduces the deterministic layer (statistics, figures, documents).

## Re-running the agent experiment (optional, needs the harness)

1. Edit `run_experiment.workflow.js` and set `REPO` to the absolute path of your
   checkout (agents need an absolute path to read each prompt file).
2. Regenerate the prompt files: `python generate_prompts.py` (they use repo-relative
   data paths, so run agents with the working directory at the repository root).
3. Execute `run_experiment.workflow.js` in the Claude Code workflow harness. It runs
   4 tasks × 5 conditions × 10 replicates with a 3× retry per cell and enforced
   structured output, returning the run array (overwrite `results_v2.json`).
4. `python analyze_v2.py` to re-score.
